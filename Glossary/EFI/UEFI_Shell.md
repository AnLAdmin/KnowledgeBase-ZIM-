The UEFI Shell is a shell/terminal for the firmware which allows launching EFI applications which include UEFI bootloaders. Apart from that, the shell can also be used to obtain various other information about the system or the firmware like memory map (memmap), modifying boot manager variables (bcfg), running partitioning programs (diskpart), loading UEFI drivers, editing text files (edit), hexedit etc. (Source: [ArchLinux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface#UEFI_Shell))
