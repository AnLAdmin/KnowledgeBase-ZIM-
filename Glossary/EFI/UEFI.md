[Unified Extensible Firmware Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified%20Extensible%20Firmware%20Interface) = [EFI](../EFI.md)

More or less. It is the open standard which was based on the original EFI.


* UEFI started as Intel's EFI in versions 1.x.
* Later, a group of companies called the UEFI Forum took over its development, which renamed it as Unified EFI starting with version 2.0.
* Unless specified as EFI 1.x, EFI and UEFI terms are used interchangeably to denote UEFI 2.x firmware.
* Apple's EFI implementation is neither a EFI 1.x version nor UEFI 2.x version but mixes up both. This kind of firmware does not fall under any one (U)EFI specification and therefore is not a standard UEFI firmware. Unless stated explicitly, these instructions are general and some of them may not work or may be different in Apple Macs.
