Created Mittwoch 04 September 2019


* Like a staple. LIFO = Last in, first out
* Data stored has to have *fixed* *known* size.
* Fast
* *Push* on the stack = Data stored on the stack
* *Pup* on the stack = Data taken from the stack
* Functions use the stack to push/pop their parameters and local variables.
