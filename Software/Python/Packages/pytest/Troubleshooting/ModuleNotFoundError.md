Description

You can get an **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'module' **error if you import parts of the Python package to test into the test module while running pytest.

As you say yourself pytest basically assumes you have the PYTHONPATH setup up correctly. There are several ways of achieving this:


* Give your project a setup.py and use pip install -e . in a virtualenv for this project. This is probably the standard method.
* As a variation on this if you have a virtualenv but no setup.py use your venv's facility to add the projects directory on sys.path, e.g. pew add . if you use pew, or add2virtualenv . if you use virtualenv and the extensions of virtualenvwrapper.
* If you always like the current working directory on sys.path you can simply always export PYTHONPATH='' in your shell. That is ensure the empty string on on sys.path which python will interpret as the current working direcotry. This is potentially a security hazard though.
* My own favourite hack, abuse how pytest loads conftest files: put an empty conftest.py in the project's top-level directory.


The reason for pytest to behave this way is to make it easy to run the tests in a tests/ directory of a checkout against an installed package. If it would unconditionally add the project directory to the PYTHONPATH then this would not be possible anymore.
