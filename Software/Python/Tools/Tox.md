tox aims to automate and standardize testing in Python. It is part of a larger vision of easing the packaging, testing and release process of Python software.
tox is a generic virtualenv management and test command line tool you can use for:
checking your package installs correctly with different Python versions and interpreters
running your tests in each of the environments, configuring your test tool of choice
acting as a frontend to Continuous Integration servers, greatly reducing boilerplate and merging CI and shell-based testing.
