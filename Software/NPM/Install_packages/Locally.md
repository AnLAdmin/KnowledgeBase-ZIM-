Install packages **only** for the **current** user on the computer. * This is the default behavior. *([Src](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-packages-locally))

$ npm install <package_name>

This will create the **node_modules** directory in your current directory (if one doesnâ€™t exist yet) and will download the package to that directory.
