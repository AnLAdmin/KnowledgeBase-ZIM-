Created Mittwoch 20 November 2019

>		greater than
<		less than
>=		greater than or equal to
<=		less than or equal to
(==)	equal to (without the brackets)

This operators do not do automatic type conversions:
(===)	**precisly** equal to (without the brackets), e.g. "" === false -> false
!==		**precisly **not equal to
