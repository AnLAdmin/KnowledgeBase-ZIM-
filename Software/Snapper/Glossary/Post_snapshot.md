# Post snapshot
Created Sonntag 31 Juli 2022

A post snapshot serves as the end point to the pre snapshot. The coupled pre and post snapshots define a range for comparison. By default, every new snapper volume is configured to create a background comparison after a related post snapshot is created successfully.
